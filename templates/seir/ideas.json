        "Experiment": "Modify the seir_eq function to implement multiple thresholds for adjusting the contact rate based on the proportion of infected individuals. Define specific behavior change scenarios (e.g., reduced contact rates at 1%, 5%, 10% infection levels) and analyze their impacts on peak infections and total infections. This will allow for a more detailed understanding of how varying public health responses can influence disease spread.",

Update the differential equations to include terms that reflect this variability. Analyze how different distributions influence epidemic metrics like peak infections, total infections, and duration. This approach avoids the computational intensity of Monte Carlo simulations while still capturing the effects of heterogeneity.",

For example, add a noise term to dS, dE, dI, and dR proportional to sqrt(v[i]) where i represents the respective compartment. Use np.random.normal to generate noise during each time step. Run the modified SEIR model multiple times (e.g., 100 simulations) to generate an ensemble of outcomes. Analyze the mean and standard deviation of key metrics such as peak infections, outbreak duration, and total infections across all runs. Investigate how different parameter regimes (e.g., low beta, short latent periods) amplify or dampen stochastic effects.",

Define a small, predefined contact matrix representing interaction rates between subgroups (e.g., high contact within groups, low or medium contact between groups). Modify the seir_eq function to calculate transitions for each subgroup based on intra-group and inter-group interactions. For each group, dS will depend on infections within the same group and from other groups weighted by the contact matrix. Simulate scenarios such as isolated groups, interconnected groups, and unequal group sizes to analyze their effects on epidemic outcomes (e.g., peak infections, outbreak duration). Compare these results against a homogeneous population model to demonstrate the importance of group-based dynamics.",
